Welcome to Dockoo! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

Dockoo is an open-source Markdown-based documentation template based on [Markdoc](https://markdoc.io) and built on top of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). Markdoc extends Markdown with a [custom syntax](https://markdoc.io/docs/syntax) for tags and annotations, providing a way to tailor content to individual users and introduce interactive elements.
